# CS2400_spaghettiCode - Project 3
A repository for the group projects in CS2400.03. The Group includes : Ryan Larson, Allan Chan, And Estevan Delgado. 

Ryan Larson wrote the code for DriverBT and also did the test cases for TestBT.  He has also edited the project video.

Allan Chan wrote the code for BinaryNode and also helped write some code on BinaryTree. He has also provided the Javadoc page.

Estevan Delgado wrote code for the BinaryTree and helped write some of the code on BinaryNode.

We used JUnit as our Java unit testing framework to demonstrate our understanding on binary trees as well as their operations, including finding the post-order traversal, the height of the tree or a node on the tree, and the number of nodes on a tree or a subtree of a given node. 

The video was recorded using OBS Studio and was edited using Adobe Premier.
