# CS2400_spaghettiCode - Project 5
A repository for the group projects in CS2400.03. The Group includes : Ryan Larson, Allan Chan, And Estevan Delgado. 

Ryan Larson wrote the code for DirectedGraph and helped set-up the driver program by creating the directed graph, including the display of the traversal orders.

Allan Chan wrote some of the code for DirectedGraph and the driver program that implements and displays the graph representations of the created directed graph.

Estevan Delgado created and led the creation of unit testing and helped with debugging the program when methods were not working as intended. 

Altogether, the group wrote the other files that were necessary for the graph's basic operations and traversals, including the implementation of lists, stacks, queues, and vertices.

Extra features : JUnit testing, Java interfaces and generics, and both graph representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list)
